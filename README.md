# Core Java Reference Programs

## Purpose

This repository is a personal reference for my Java learning, and interview preparation. All files are organized by package and topic for easy retrieval and review.

## What it contains

- Quickly look up example Java programs for **OOP concepts, collections, and file handling**.
- Refer to working code samples to solve compilation errors or learn specific syntax/features.
- Copy-paste or adapt code fragments when building projects or preparing for hackathons/interviews.
- Maintain organized folders mirroring my IDE structure for direct access.

## Structure

- `src/com.corejava` — Basic Java programs: OOP, multithreading, exceptions.
- `src/com.corejava.collections` — Collection framework examples (ArrayList, HashMap, custom comparators, sets).
- `src/com.corejava.FileHandling` — File reading/writing, serialization, merging files, etc.
- Text files (`aaaa.txt`, `abcd.txt`, `bbbb.txt`) for quick testing and file I/O demos.

## Quick Reference

- Each package shows all relevant `.java` files—browse or search by filename.
- No build files or dependencies—just basic Java code.
- No external libraries used.

## How to Use (for Myself)

- Open any `.java` file directly in my IDE (Eclipse) when I need a concept clarified.
- Copy code snippets for assignments, quizzes, or technical interviews.
- Update with new examples if I learn something new or fix bugs.
- Ignore `.txt` files except for file handling demos.

## Notes

- For personal learning, not intended for collaboration or public use.
- Latest Java SE version recommended (JavaSE-21 preferred).
- Folder layout matches my local IDE (Eclipse).
